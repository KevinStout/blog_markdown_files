To get files from Bitbucket using its REST API, you can follow these general steps. Keep in mind that APIs and their endpoints might change over time, so I'll provide a general outline that you can adapt to the current Bitbucket API version.

1. **Authentication:**
   First, you need to authenticate yourself to access the Bitbucket API. You'll typically use Basic Authentication, OAuth, or Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for this. PATs are recommended for security reasons. You can create a PAT within your Bitbucket account settings.

2. **Construct the API Endpoint:**
   The API endpoint you'll use to retrieve files depends on the specific context of your request. For example, if you want to get files from a specific repository, you'll use an endpoint like:

   ```
   GET /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/src/{branch}/{file_path}
   ```

   Replace `{workspace}`, `{repo_slug}`, `{branch}`, and `{file_path}` with the appropriate values.

3. **Make the API Request:**
   Use your preferred programming language and HTTP library to make a GET request to the constructed API endpoint. Include the necessary headers for authentication (e.g., `Authorization` header for OAuth or `Authorization: Bearer <PAT>` for PAT).

   Here's an example in Python using the `requests` library:

   ```python
   import requests

   base_url = "https://api.bitbucket.org"
   workspace = "your_workspace"
   repo_slug = "your_repo"
   branch = "main"
   file_path = "path/to/your/file.txt"
   api_endpoint = f"{base_url}/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/src/{branch}/{file_path}"

   headers = {
       "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   }

   response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)

   if response.status_code == 200:
       file_contents = response.text
       print(file_contents)
   else:
       print(f"Failed to retrieve file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
   ```

Remember to adapt the code to your specific programming language and library of choice.

4. **Process the Response:**
   Once you receive the response, you can process the file contents as needed. In the example above, the file contents are printed to the console, but you can save them to a local file, process the data, etc., depending on your requirements.

Please note that Bitbucket's API might change over time, so it's a good practice to consult the official Bitbucket API documentation for the most up-to-date information on endpoints, authentication methods, and data formats.
